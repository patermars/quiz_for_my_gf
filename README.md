# 🌙 The "Where's My Moon?" Quiz

A cute little game I made for my girlfriend because apparently pointing at random pictures is more romantic than buying flowers... 🌹

## 📱 What's This Thing?
It's a simple quiz game where you:
1. Click on pictures (hopefully the right ones)
2. Get to the end
3. Find out there's no moon
4. BUT... surprise! Your camera opens up because YOU are the moon! 
   (Smooth, right? 😏)

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Open `index.html` (yes, it's that simple)
2. Click "Start" (you can handle this part)
3. Find the things in the pictures
4. Try to find the moon
5. Look pretty for the camera! 📸

## 📝 Requirements
- A web browser (duh!)
- A camera (for the cheesy ending)
- Someone special to play it with (aww)(Main and Most Important Requirement)
- Basic ability to click on pictures


## ⚠️ Warning
Side effects may include:
- Excessive smiling
- Spontaneous hugs (if she's not angry)
- Eye rolling (but the good kind)

## 🤔 Why Did I Make This?
Because sometimes you need to remind someone they're special in the nerdiest way possible! Also she was angry on me, and I had no other way to make it up to her.
